## Collating location of simulation results

The code in `gen-simres-paths-table.R` collects the location of results of each simulation
scenario into a CSV file. The simulation scenarion can be specified inside the `R` code.

The resulting CSV files are used as part of plotting.

## Plotting

The `R` code in `plot-bias_v_se-manual_yaxis_range.R` generates the funnel plots (figures of
the manuscript). It allows the y-axis of plots in each simulation scenario to be specified so
figures can be made consistent. It calls other functions to perform the actual plotting. The
script obtains the data from CSV files that contains the location of the actual results; these
CSV files are generated by `gen-simres-paths-table.R`

Individual plots are placed inside cells of a template, `figures-template.svg`.
This template can be open in drawing tools such as diagrams.net (formery draw.io).

## Calcuates mean difference of average bias

`calc_avgdiffabsbias.R` contains code that will read the collated simulation result
file (generated by `gen-simres-paths-table.R`) and calculates the mean differences.
